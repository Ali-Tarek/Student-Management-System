# Student Management System (C++)

## Overview

Welcome to the Student Management System, a C++ program designed to efficiently store and manage student information using various data structures,
including Binary Search Tree (BST), AVL Tree, Min Heap, and Max Heap.

## Features

This program offers a flexible solution for organizing student data, allowing users to choose between different data structures based on their specific needs.
The implemented data structures ensure efficient operations for adding, removing, searching, and displaying student information.


2. **Main Menu:**
   - The program presents a main menu with options to choose the desired data structure:
     1. BST (Binary Search Tree)
     2. AVL (AVL Tree)
     3. Min Heap
     4. Max Heap
     5. Exit Program

3. **Tree-Specific Menus:**
   - Each tree option (BST, AVL, Min Heap, Max Heap) has its own menu with operations specific to that data structure.

4. **File Structure:**
     - main.cpp         # Main program source code
     - bst.cpp          # Binary Search Tree implementation
     - avl.cpp          # AVL Tree implementation
     - min_heap.cpp     # Min Heap implementation
     - max_heap.cpp     # Max Heap implementation
     - student.cpp      # Student class implementation
     - student.h        # Header file for the Student class
     - input.txt        # Example input file
